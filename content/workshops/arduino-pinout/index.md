## Meet Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language, and the Arduino Software (IDE).

## The Board

Throughout the workshops, you will be using a particular model of Arduino: the Mega 2560. This board is perfect to mess around with, thanks to its many pins (54 Digital Pins and 16 Analog Pins!) and its 256 Kilobytes of free memory. It might not seem a lot to you, as PCs nowadays usually have more than 8 Gigabytes of memory, but, as you will find out by thinkering with the board, it's more than sufficient for most projects done with Arduino!

Below you'll find an image that explains what each pin on the board is and what it is capable of doing. If you want to see it more clearly, you can open the image in a new tab by pressing the button below.

That's it! You can now take a look at the other tutorials for more info on the individual components.
